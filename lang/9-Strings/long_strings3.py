long = "And then some adenoidal typists from Birmingham with\n\
flabby white legs and diarrhoea trying to pick up hairy bandy-\n\
legged wop waiters called Manuel and once a week there's an\n\
excursion to the local Roman Ruins to buy cherryade and melted\n\
ice cream and bleeding Watney's Red Barrel and one evening you\n\
visit the so called typical restaurant with local colour and\n\
atmosphere and you sit next to a party from Rhyl who keep\n\
singing 'Torremolinos, torremolinos' and complaining about the\n\
food - 'It's so greasy here, isn't it?' - and you get cornered\n\
by some drunken greengrocer from Luton with an Instamatic\n\
camera and Dr. Scholl sandals and last Tuesday's Daily Express\n\
and he drones on and on and on about how Mr. Smith should be\n\
running this country and how many languages Enoch Powell can\n\
speak and then he throws up over the Cuba Libres."
